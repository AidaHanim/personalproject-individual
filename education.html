<center><p>These are the pictures during my diploma. I am a graduate of the Diploma in Planting Industry Management at UiTM Jasin, Melaka. During my diploma, I have joined many associations. So, this is my favourite team in the association which is the Malay Language Society (MLS) association. This team very helpful because it wisely manages the association and acts quickly in the group as planned. This team is very friendly with each other. This is the reason why I like this association the most because it is really enjoyable. </p>

<center><p>Now, I continue my study in Islamic Banking at UiTM Kota Bharu, Kelantan. I realize the higher we learn, the more knowledge we gain. But believe me it is not that easy. We need to strive to achieve our dreams. I am also happy to continue studying here because I have many new friends. But during my second semester, our country and the rest world experienced the covid-19 pandemic. So, UiTM and other institutions had to be closed and students had to study at their respective homes. We had to study ODL which is Open and Distance Learning at home. It is very challenging for students because they have to study online but we managed to overcome the challenge. </p>
