<center><p>This is my beloved family. The persons who are always there when I am sad and happy. I have an older sister, three older brothers and a younger sister.I also have a cute niece. Loving family is a trust for every human being. Appreciate them while they are still alive. I always keep the words of my parents "Communication in the family will always be maintained as long as communication with God is maintained. If God loves a family, then one of the characteristics is that the family is open-hearted to religious knowledge. The happiness of a family is not measured in terms of things, but the extent of the family's obedience to God".I like the way my father educated us as a family. The more we treat our children, the more they will treat us. So give them the best attitude. Last words, God loves those who are always struggling to improve themselves, their families and their communities. </p>
